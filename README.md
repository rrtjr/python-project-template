# Just Another Python Project Template

[![CI Pipeline](https://github.com/rrtjr/python-project-template/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/rrtjr/python-project-template/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

## Description

Welcome to my Python Starter Kit! As someone who often finds myself recreating project setups from scratch, I created this template to streamline the process and ensure consistency across my projects. This template provides a solid foundation for rapid development, saving time and effort in the initial setup phase. This template will be handy for me and anyone looking to kickstart their Python projects efficiently.

## Features

1. **Setup Script**: Includes a `setup_project.py` script to simplify the initial setup process for new projects, allowing you to easily rename the project and configure initial settings.

2. **Dependency Management**: Utilizes `pyproject.toml` and Poetry for efficient dependency management and project configuration, ensuring a modern and streamlined development workflow.

3. **GitHub Workflows**: Integrated GitHub Actions workflows for seamless CI/CD, release automation, and package updates:
    - **CI Workflow**: Automatically runs tests and checks code coverage with each commit to maintain code quality and reliability.
    - **Release Workflow**: Automates version bumping and publishing releases to streamline the release process.
    - **Package Update Workflow**: Automatically checks and updates Python package dependencies on a regular schedule to keep your project up-to-date.

4. **Code Coverage**: Incorporates `pytest-cov` to measure and report code coverage, integrated with the CI workflow to ensure comprehensive test coverage.

5. **Pre-commit Hooks**: Configured pre-commit hooks to maintain code quality and prevent common issues before they are pushed to remote.

6. **VSCode Configuration**: Provides `.vscode/settings.json` for a consistent development environment setup in Visual Studio Code, enhancing the developer experience.

7. **Documentation**: Includes a `README.md` template to guide the documentation of the project, ensuring clear and comprehensive project information from the start.

8. **Tests Directory**: Set up a `tests` directory with sample unit tests using `unittest` or `pytest`, facilitating test-driven development and ensuring code reliability.

9. **Python Version**: Specifies the Python version used by the project in a `.python-version` file, ensuring consistency across different development environments.

Certainly! Hereâ€™s a detailed section on how to use the project template:

## How to Use This Project Template

### 1. Clone the Template Repository

First, clone the project template repository to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rrtjr/python-project-template new_project
cd new_project
```

### 2. Run the Setup Script

Run the setup script to configure your project with a new name and initial settings:

```sh
python setup_project.py
```

The script will prompt you to enter the new project name and will update all relevant files and directories accordingly.

### 3. Initialize a New Git Repository

After the setup script runs, remove the old `.git` directory and initialize a new Git repository:

```sh
rm -rf .git
git init
git checkout -b main
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit with updated project name"
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/new_project_name.git
git config branch.main.remote origin
git config branch.main.merge refs/heads/main
git config branch.main.vscode-merge-base origin/main
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories # Then follow instructions to resolve conflicts
git push -u origin main
```

This assumes you have an empty git repository. Should you have an existing and wanting to merge you can combine histories by:

```sh
git merge origin/main --allow-unrelated-histories
```

You can then proceed ub resolving the conflicts (e.g. pyproject.toml, workflows, .pre-commit-config)

### 4. Install Dependencies

Use Poetry to install the project dependencies defined in `pyproject.toml`:

```sh
poetry env use $(pyenv which python)
poetry install
```

### 5. Setup Pre-commit Hooks

Install pre-commit hooks to maintain code quality and prevent common issues:

```sh
pre-commit install
```

### 6. Running Tests (TODO)

Run the tests using `pytest` to ensure everything is working correctly:

```sh
poetry run pytest
```

### 7. Using the CI/CD Workflows

The template comes with pre-configured GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD, release automation, and package updates. These workflows are automatically triggered based on your GitHub repository's activity:

- **CI Workflow**: Runs tests and checks code coverage with each commit.
- **Release Workflow**: Automates version bumping and publishing releases.
- **Package Update Workflow**: Checks and updates Python package dependencies on a regular schedule.

Ensure your repository on GitHub is set up with the necessary permissions and tokens for these workflows to function correctly.

### 8. VSCode Configuration

The template includes a `.vscode/settings.json` file for a consistent development environment setup in Visual Studio Code. Open the project in VSCode to take advantage of the predefined settings.

#### 9. Documentation

Update the `README.md` file to include relevant information about your new project. Use the provided template as a guide to ensure clear and comprehensive documentation.

#### 10. Python Version

The `.python-version` file specifies the Python version used by the project. Ensure your development environment uses the same Python version to maintain consistency.
